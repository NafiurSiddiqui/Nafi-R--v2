							<span class="text-greetings">Hi! üëã</span>
							A little about me. I dabbled my feet into the world of coding in late 2019. Started
                            with HTML to see how it goes. Always starting out with the end result as a vision would hype me
                            up to get the process rolling. Soon in 2020 I fell in love with the whole
                            process itself more than the end result and built up the habit of
                            coding an application from the ground up for hours. The dabbling became
                            an addiction to code and learning amazing new technologies out there, embracing the mentality to become a bug bounty. üïµÔ∏è

							Below is the history of the technologies I learned so far.

						<h3>React and its echo-system </h3>
            <h6> March - Sepetmber</h6>

            <hr>
						<p>
              Always heard in the community that how picking up a framework made it far more easier to develop the application for client-side as well. That I realized while learning React in depth. I quickly understand the buzz about the React and how simple it makes it to develop a client-side application without the need to implement JS in such pedantic ways. <br> <br>

              Feel free to explore my <a href="https://github.com/TheHunter808?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github </a> repo for all the projects I worked on with React alongside its echosystem like Redux, NextJs, TypeScript with React.

						<h3>Data structures and algorithm with C</h3>
            <h6> January - April </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
              I realized about the enhancement I needed and spent 4 months learnign data structes and algorithm in C, and learned the beauty of C. We can always argue about why do I call a pedantic language like C a beauty. ü§ì <br> <br>

              I finished <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a> course from Harvard University's free computer science course available from EdX online. But did not get any certifications since they also want the candidates to finish the full-stack and crude cybersecurity course and projects there, which was not in conjunction with my roadmap.

						<h3>HTML e-mail development and Nafi</h3>
            <h6> June - Decemeber </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
              I am a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingPhase" target="_blank"> CodingPhase</a> and I was in need of a job. Since it was taking a bit longer than I expected (as usual), and saw the demand of HTML e-mail developers in the field. I gave it a shot realizing it would be an easy-peasy! <br> <br>

              what was not "easy-peasy" was landing the job. I tried in the international market and locals as well, problem occured in the international due to not my skill but they needed me on-site and with the locals, email development is not as demanding as it is in the international market. <br> <br>

              That is how I spent learning the email development and campaign strategy on the foundational level.
              <a href="https://nafi-v1.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is my very first newbie dev portfolio I built with my newbie design sense. ü•¥

						<h3>JavaScript & Sass </h3>
            <h6> June 20 - Aug 21 </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
              I got good at styling aspect of the application but something was bugging me and I wanted to take the frontend up a notch and see some life in it, where frontend can communicates with the distant galaxy, "The Backend" to bring the might of the magic on client-side. <br> <br>

              Started learning JavaScript and kept learning throughout the mid 2020 until mid 2021 and made tons of major and minor projects. I soon realized the vastness and the ultimate power of JS. Kept learning and digging about the JS echo system.

						<h3>CSS</h3>
						<h6> Whole year </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
							Right after getting a good hang of HTML, I learned to add styling, flesh and appearance in my world, to the mark ups and made it unique and presentable to the world. <br> <br>

              with the extensive CSS3 features like animation, flex, grid, responsive unit, I quickly fell in love with the magic of frontend development.

						<h3>HTML certificaion</h3>
            <h6> Aug 2019 - March 2020 </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
							This was the time when I deeply get engaged into the world of mark
							up, Skeleton üíÄ in my vision, and started putting them all
							together, giving websites the very foundation it needs. I got
							engaged into the deep HTML topics like the accessibility,
							semantics and some cool tags that eradicates the need for builidng
							such functionality from scratch like, a bunch of input types and
							hacky attributes like download. <br />

							For instance,
							<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1jWJ4Jxy7Y8LrApZkf-aHPx9xoLUdNwhB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a>
							my HTML certification.
