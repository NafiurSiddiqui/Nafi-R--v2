						A little about me. I dabbled my feet into the world of coding in
						late 2019. Started with HTML to see how it goes. Always starting out
						with the end result as a vision would hype me up to get the process
						rolling. Soon in 2020 I fell in love with the whole process itself
						more than the end result and built up the habit of coding an
						application from the ground up for hours. The dabbling became an
						addiction to code and learning amazing new technologies out there,
						embracing the mentality to become a bug bounty. üïµÔ∏è
						<br />
						<br />

						Below is the list of technologies I have learned to use so far.

						<h3>React and its ecosystem</h3>

						<hr />
						<p>
							Always heard in the community that how picking up a framework made
							it far more easier to develop the application for client-side as
							well. That I realized while learning React in depth. I quickly
							understand the buzz about the React and how simple it makes it to
							develop a client-side application without the need to implement JS
							in such pedantic ways. <br />
							<br />

							Feel free to explore my
							<a
								href="https://github.com/TheHunter808?tab=repositories"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
								>github
							</a>
							repo for all the projects I worked on with React alongside its
							echosystem like Redux, NextJs, TypeScript with React.

						<h3>Data structures and algorithm with C</h3>

						<hr />
						<p>
							I realized the enhancement I needed. Spent months learning data
							structures and algorithms in C, and learned the beauty of C. We
							can always argue about why do I call a pedantic language like C a
							sheer beauty. ü§ì <br />
							<br />

							I have finished
							<a

								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
								>CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a
							>
							course from Harvard University's free computer science course,
							that is available on EdX online. Did not apply for certifications
							since they require the candidates to complete the full-stack and
							cybersecurity courses and projects, which was not in conjunction
							with my roadmap for the time being..

						<h3>HTML e-mail development and Nafi</h3>

						<hr />
						<p>
							I am a fan of
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingPhase" target="_blank">
								CodingPhase</a
							>
							and needed a job. Since it was taking longer than I expected, saw
							the demand of HTML e-mail developers in the field. I gave it a
							shot realizing it would be an easy-peasy! <br />
							<br />

							what was not "easy-peasy", landing the job. I tried the
							international market and locals, lost the shot in the
							international due to the regional differences and with the locals,
							email development is not as demanding as it is in the
							international market. <br />
							<br />

							That is how I spent learning email development and campaign
							strategy on a foundational level.
							<a

							is my very first newbie dev portfolio I built with my newbie
							design sense. ü•¥

						<h3>JavaScript & Sass</h3>

						<hr />
						<p>
							I got good at the styling aspect of the application but something
							was off and wanted to take the frontend up a notch and see some
							life in it. where frontend can communicate with the distant
							galaxy, "The Backend" to bring the might of the magic on
							client-side. <br />
							<br />

							Started learning JavaScript and kept learning throughout the mid
							2020 to mid-2021. Built some mini projects. I soon realized the
							ultimate power of JS. Kept on learning and discovering
							significance of JS.

						<h2 class="text-secondary">2020</h2>
						<h3>CSS</h3>

						<hr />
						<p>
							Right after getting a good hang of HTML, I learned to add styling,
							flesh, and appearance into my world, to the markups, made it
							unique and presentable to the world. <br />
							<br />

							Discovered the extensive CSS3 features like animation, flex, grid,
							and the responsive unit, I quickly fell in love with the magic of
							front-end development.

						<h3>HTML certificaion</h3>

						<hr />
						<p>
							I got deeply engaged into the world of markup, bones üíÄ in my
							vision, and started putting them together. Gave my projects the
							foundation they needed and discovered more advanced topics that
							makes a site quite rich in terms of markup. <br />

							For instance,
							<a

								target="_blank"

							my HTML certification.
