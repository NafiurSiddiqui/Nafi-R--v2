					<p>
						I dabbled my feet into the world of coding in the late 2019. Started
						with HTML to see how it goes. Before I could practically see the
						result, I could see the end result as a vision and it would hype me
						up to get the process rolling. Since 2020 I fell in love with the
						process itself more than the end result and built up the habit of
						coding an application from ground up for hours. The dabbling became
						addiction to code and learn amazing new technologies out there.
						<br>
						<br>

						Below are the history of the technologies I learned so far. Since
						each company has different requirements for their tech stack, I
						would love to learn about the company, where i will be in and learn
						the tech-stack on the go and present the company to the world of
						users with sleek and playful UI and UX.

						<h3>React and its echo-system </h3>
            <h6> March - Sepetmber</h6>

            <hr>
						<p>
              Always heard in the community that how picking up a framework made it far more easier to develope the application for client-side as well. That I realized while learning React in depth. I quickly understand the buzz about the React and how simple it makes it to develope a client-side application without the need to implement JS in such pedantic ways. <br> <br>

              Feel free to explore my <a href="https://github.com/TheHunter808?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github </a> repo for all the projects I worked on with React alongside its echosystem like Redux, NextJs, TypeScript with React.

						<h3>Data structures and algorithm in C</h3>
            <h6> January - April </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
              I realized about the enhancement I needed and spent 4 months learnign data structes and algorithm in C, and learned the beauty of C. We can always argue about why do I call a pedantic language like C a beauty. ðŸ¤“ <br> <br>

              I finished <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a> course from Harvard University's free computer science course available from EdX online. But did not get any certifications since they also want the candidates to finish the full-stack and crude cybersecurity course and projects there, which was not in conjunction with my roadmap.

						<h3>HTML e-mail development and Nafi</h3>
            <h6> June - Decemeber </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
              I am a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingPhase" target="_blank"> CodingPhase</a> and I was in need of a job. Since it was taking a bit longer than I expected (as usual), and saw the demand of HTML e-mail developers in the field. I gave it a shot realizing it would be an easy-peasy! <br> <br>

              what was not "easy-peasy" was landing the job. I tried in the international market and locals as well, problem occured in the international due to not my skill but they needed me on-site and with the locals, email developement is not as demanding as it is in the international market. <br> <br>

              That is how I spent learning the email development and campaign strategy on the foundational level.
              <a href="https://nafi-v1.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is my very first newbie dev portfolio I built with my newbie design sense. ðŸ¥´

						<h3>JavaScript & Sass </h3>
            <h6> June 20 - Aug 21 </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
              I got good at styling aspect of the application but something was bugging me and I wanted to take the frontend up a notch and see some life in it, where frontend can communicates with the distant galaxy, "The Backend" to bring the might of the magic on client-side. <br> <br>

              Started learning JavaScript and kept learning throughout the mid 2020 until mid 2021 and made tons of major and minor projects. I soon realized the vastness and the ultimate power of JS. Kept learning and digging about the JS echo system.

						<h3>CSS</h3>
						<h6> Whole year </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
							Right after getting a good hang of HTML, I learned to add styling, flesh and appearance in my world, to the mark ups and made it unique and presentable to the world. <br> <br>

              with the extensive CSS3 features like animation, flex, grid, responsive unit, I quickly fell in love with the magic of frontend developement.

						<h3>HTML certificaion</h3>
            <h6> Aug 2019 - March 2020 </h6>
            <hr>
						<p>
							This was the time when I deeply get engaged into the world of mark
							up, Skeleton ðŸ’€ in my vision, and started putting them all
							together, giving websites the very foundation it needs. I got
							engaged into the deep HTML topics like the accessibility,
							semantics and some cool tags that eradicates the need for builidng
							such functionality from scratch like, a bunch of input types and
							hacky attributes like download. <br>

							For instance,
							<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1jWJ4Jxy7Y8LrApZkf-aHPx9xoLUdNwhB" download="" target="_blank">
								Download
							</a>
							my HTML certification.
